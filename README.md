## Project Features

This project is live and currently functions as the Bravo Echo Web Development main website. This website features a full-screen video splash component for the home page and a tagline hero that uses animation for a scrolling effect. Pages include a Marketing section with embedded videos, a Designs section displaying a 'need/solution' approach, and a Contact section with embedded contact form.

## Technologies

This project uses React and several packages for front-end design. Styling is accomplished with Sass, Bootstrap, Animate.css and the Styled Components package. Video media are displayed with the Video-react package from NPM.

## Future Development

Features in future development include a payment portal for existing clients and a blog section for SEO content. I am continuously updating and adding features that will further legitimize the professionalism of my freelance business.
